# Find The Beat

**Project by: Michal Krawczyk**

Find The Beat is a dynamic music-based memory pattern game, designed and developed by Michal Krawczyk. The project was initially conceptualized for a hackathon held in November 2022. Although it didn't gain recognition during the hackathon, the idea was revisited, leading to a full-fledged game that challenges both memory and rhythm skills.

## Gameplay Instructions

1. **Start the Game:** Click on the Start button.
2. **Choose Your Level:** Depending on your confidence, select a level. This will determine the sequence length, which can be anything from 2 to 7 tones.
3. **Memory Challenge:** A unique sequence corresponding to the selected level will play. Make sure to memorize it!
4. **Recreate the Sequence:** After the sequence has played out, you'll get 10 seconds to reproduce it correctly.
5. **Score Points:** Successfully reproducing the sequence rewards you with points. The points you earn are proportional to the level you chose.
6. **Lives & Challenges:** Be cautious! Failing to recreate the sequence, missing a beat, or running out of time results in the loss of a life. Keep progressing through the levels and face new sequences to test your memory and rhythm skills to the fullest.
