## How to play

- There will be a random 7-sequence beat scattered around the board's instrumments.
- You will then be given 3 seconds to memorise the beat/locations of the sounds.
- Select all the correct instrumments in the correct order to earn 1 point.
- If you fail to select atleast 1 sound you will lose 1 Life.
- If any beat is missed you will lose 1 Life.
- If the sequence is not correct you will lose 1 Life.
- You will then be given a new sequance in the next round.

## Project Overview

Find the beat is a music-based memory pattern game.  
The application was made by Monika, Michal, Bogdan, and Sador.

- When start the game is pressed player is introduced to 3 seconds loading stage until the game board is shown.
  After that what is supposed to happen is, a 7-beat pattern scattered around the board of instruments.
  If the user fails to register at least 1 beat the program should remove 1 life
  When the player guessed all beats they will then move on to the next sequence.
- There is a levels button option - this should increase the number of beats to a higher number to memorize.
- The reset button will reset the sequence mid-game if user chooses so.
